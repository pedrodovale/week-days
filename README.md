# Week days

A very simple program to output the week days of a given month in a given year.

## The story

My goal is to replace Shell as my go-to scripting language.

It's the first python program I'm committing, hence the simplicity ;-)  

## How to test it

Just run the `main.py` script:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

It should show this:

> What's date that you want to work on (YYYY-MM)?
